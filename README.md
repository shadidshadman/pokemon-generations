# Why MIT as a licence?

The MIT License is concise, permissive, and open-source. It allows for a lot of flexibility and compatibility in general and works great for open-source and commercial projects, so it works well for my purposes.

# Overview of the project

Pokemon holds a dear place in my heart and so I wanted to make a simple website that celebrated the nostalgia a bit. It references the first five generations of the series (there are now 9 generations these days!) and acted as a good chance for me to revisit the magic and consider what parts of them were my favourite. It has a brief initial section indicating this fondness as an overview, multiple bulbapedia links to the generations, pokemon games, and characters themselves as well as images along with them.

# Tech Stack

React.js is something that I have read a lot of tutorials on and watched videos about in the last week and so I was hoping to take part in using some of the html/css/javascript/react knowledge I've procured, and I did not previously have any experience using github pages, it was quite a stressful time to figure out but it was a valuable learning experience, especially when resolving issues fell into place finally!
